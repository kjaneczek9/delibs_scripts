# Trouble shooting
Bugs found so far:

When creating delibs slides or plus/minus form, if the headshot is anything besides a jpg or png, the script will fail. The script tells you who failed and will skip this person. 

Download their headshot, export it as a .jpg/.jpeg and replace the id to the link in the response form. 

Occasionally .jpg/.jpeg files will fail and you may need to add them in manually if exporting them doesn't work.
